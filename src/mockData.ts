When we first decided to make a new statement loudspeaker from Bang & Olufsen, the question wasn't, "What are we going to build?".

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,590
The question was, "What do we want it to sound like when you're sitting and listening to music?".

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,720
And in order to answer that question we had to go out and listen to loudspeakers.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:28,730
We went out and listened to Bang & Olufsen loudspeakers, our competitors loudspeakers, to consumer level products, to studio monitors and studios, and we came back with a long list of qualities.

5
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,030
One speaker that we heard had really good bass.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,700
Another had really good mid range.

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,320
One had really good imaging but you couldn't move when you listened to it.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,770
Another sounded like itself no matter what room it was in.

9
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,710
So we had this list of characteristics that we wanted this new loudspeaker to have.

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,910
And then the question was, "How do we get that list into one product?".

11
00:00:51,610 --> 00:01:16,540
That meant that it had to be able to change its characteristics as well because a loudspeaker that's designed for one person who's sitting with their eyes closed listening to a recording and doing nothing else isn't the same as a loudspeaker that's designed to deliver really good speech intelligibility with the nightly news, or to be used when you're listening to the soundtrack of a movie, or as background music in a party.

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:32,600
So, that list of qualities wasn't just for one speaker, it was for a speaker that full fulfils many different roles and is flexible enough to change so that it can be a different loudspeaker depending on how you're using it.`;
