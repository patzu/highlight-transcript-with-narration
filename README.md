# üìú Highlight Transcript with Narration

Welcome to the **Highlight Transcript with Narration** project! This application synchronizes text with an audio narration, highlighting the text as the audio plays, providing an immersive reading and listening experience.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to create a seamless and synchronized experience where an audio narration plays while the corresponding text is highlighted in real-time. It can be particularly useful for educational purposes, language learning, and any other scenarios where synchronized audio-text presentation is beneficial.

## üåü Features

- **Audio Playback**: Plays the narration audio file.
- **Text Highlighting**: Highlights the text in sync with the audio narration.
- **Pre-included Narrations and Transcriptions**: Comes with pre-included audio and transcription files for easy setup.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Updates the text highlighting in real-time as the audio plays.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:patzu/highlight-transcript-with-narration.git
cd highlight-transcript-with-narration
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üé® Usage

- The project comes with pre-included audio files and their corresponding transcripts.
- Simply run the application to see the text highlighting in sync with the audio narration.

## üìù Example Transcript Format

Here is an example of what the transcript looks like in `generatedTranscript.ts`:

```ts
const mockData = `1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:07,310
In Java, Collections.synchronizedMap(Map) and ConcurrentHashMap serve different purposes and have different performance characteristics.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,590
Collections.synchronizedMap(Map):

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,720
This method returns a synchronized (thread-safe) map backed by the specified map. It achieves thread safety by synchronizing all access to the backing map.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:28,730
Performance-wise, while it provides thread safety, it can suffer from performance bottlenecks under high concurrency because it uses a single lock for all operations, potentially leading to contention among threads.

5
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,030
It's suitable for situations where you need thread safety with relatively low concurrency or where you need to use legacy code that expects a Map interface.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,700
ConcurrentHashMap:

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,320
This class is designed for high-concurrency scenarios. It provides thread safety without a significant performance penalty by using a different approach than Collections.synchronizedMap.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,770
It achieves thread safety by dividing the map into segments, each of which can be locked independently. This reduces contention and allows multiple threads to read and write concurrently.

9
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,710
ConcurrentHashMap offers better scalability and performance under high concurrency compared to Collections.synchronizedMap.

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,910
It's more suitable for applications where high concurrency is expected or where performance under concurrent access is critical.

11
00:00:51,610 --> 00:01:16,540
In summary, if you're working in a high-concurrency environment and need thread safety with good performance, ConcurrentHashMap is likely the better choice. However, if you're dealing with low to moderate concurrency or legacy code, Collections.synchronizedMap might suffice. Always benchmark and test in your specific use case to determine the best option.`;
